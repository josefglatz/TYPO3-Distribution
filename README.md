# josefglatz/TYPO3-Distribution

[![StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/66637769/shield?branch=master)](https://styleci.io/repos/66637769/)

This repository delivers a full configured, bare metal TYPO3
distribution based on my best practices.

> The goal of this package is to give an example of how a TYPO3 project
> could be configured and structured for real world scenarios. It is
> updated on a regular basis to reflect the current development of TYPO3
> CMS. It's used by me as an advanced TYPO3 boilerplate for real world
> TYPO3 projects.
