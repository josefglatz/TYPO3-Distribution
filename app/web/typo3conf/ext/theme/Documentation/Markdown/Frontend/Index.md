This TYPO3-Distribution does not provide an 100% finished frontend out-of-the-box. It is not intended therefore! It provides a fundamental base for integrating your website. All the default database
records helps you to start developing/integrating your frontend of your new TYPO3 website with an ready to use pagetree in the backend.

## What you can expect when you set up this TYPO3 distribution with default database records?

**The necessary steps are basically:**

* Finalize/Adopt your page tree
* Finalize/Adopt backendLayouts (if you need additional OR configure colPos's)
* Integrate your frontend via Fluid
* Write Scss/Css
* Write Javascript
* Configure Yarn/Gulp setup
